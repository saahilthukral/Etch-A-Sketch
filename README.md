# Etch-A-Sketch
This is a simple Etch-A-Sketch that I have created using JavaScript DOM Methods

This project has improved my programming logic, as I had split all the problems into sub-problems to make it easier for me to focus.

While working on this project, I had to Google a lot to figure out all the issues I have been facing. 

2 of the main issues that I faced were: 

--> How to choose random values for colour codes    (unlike python, there isn't a proper library for generated random values within a range). (Solved by looking at answers from StackOverflow)

--> How to create a grid display with number of rows and columns in the grid. (Solved by setting display to grid in CSS and using DOM methods for grids to select the number of rows and the size of the rows as well.)
